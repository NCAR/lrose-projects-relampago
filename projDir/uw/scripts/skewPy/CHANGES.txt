v0.1.0 01 July 2013 -- Initial Release!

v0.1.1 03 July 2013 -- Very minor changes to docs and figure plotting.

v0.1.2 08 July 2013 -- A number of changes:
    - Added a parcel ascent routine based on provided pressure, dewpoint and 
      temperature. This routine adds some characteristics to the plot in the 
      upper LHS. TODO: initialise parcels automatically, calculate CAPE and 
      CIN and Precipitable water... 
    - Removed reliance on rcParams to make the figure look pretty. Did this 
      because I got annoyed (and I'm sure that others will too) at what 
      happens to graphs plotted subsequently... they end up with yellow axes 
      etc. 
    - Improved some of the aesthetics of the plot... moved standard 
      atmosphere height axis to right hand side.

v0.1.3 25 July 2013 -- Minor changes (New release for pypi):
    - Fixed Masked Value error in add_profile (Thanks Simon). The routing 
      now enforces masked values so that an exception is not raised when 
      counting the number of barbs to draw [nbarbs=(~uu.mask).sum()]
    - Added an automated parcel routine. This works by analysing the lowest 
      few levels (kwarg mixheight in mbar) to give:
	- surface pressure (pressure of lowest level)
	- surface temperature [derived from max(theta)] in lowst levels
	- surface dew point [derived from mean(mixr)] in lowest levels
      This seems to give pretty good agreement with the parcels in the BOM 
      soundings, but I can't make it perfect. I presume they use a forecast 
      daily max T for the parcel instead of a mixed value. The ability to 
      define your own parcel is retained but plot_skewt() now automatically 
      plots a parcel.
    - Added a couple of routines to thermodynamics.py to enable this to 
      work. TempK now calculates temperature given theta an pressure (I 
      can't believe I didn't already have this)
